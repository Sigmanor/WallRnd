## Contributing
I know that there are many similar apps that probably offer richer functionality. And I also understand that exists more suitable tools for creating such apps, but this app was created only for learning delphi. Thats mean even if there will be some updates, it will be only bug fixing. That don't mean that you can't propose any improvements. Create an issue or pull request, your welcome.
